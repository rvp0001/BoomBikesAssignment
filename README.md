# Project Name
Bike Sharing linear regression model building

## Table of Contents
* This is EDA and Linear Model building project where we analyse various parameters that affect demand of bikes.
    Mostly process followed are data  understanding ,cleaning  manipulation,analysis,model building,model validation and presentation
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas,seaborn,sklearn,statsmodels and matplotlib are fantastic libraries that speed up EDA.
* Upgrad staff and peers

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- This is EDA and Linear Model building project where we analyse various parameters that affect demand of bikes.
- To understand model building using Linear regression
- To understand paramaters that affect demand of bikes and how they help in building model.
- Linear regression for model building and validation.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Demand is dependent on temperature
- Demand is dependent on time of year
- Gradual Increase in demand with time
- Demand decreases slightly with windspeed.
